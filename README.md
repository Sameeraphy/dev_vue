To install the dependencies listed in the "package.json" file of a Vue.js project, you can use the npm (Node Package Manager) package manager. Here are the steps to install the dependencies:
1) Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory.
2) Run the following command: "npm install".
This command will read the "package.json" file and install all the dependencies listed in it. The installed packages will be stored in a "node_modules" directory within the project directory.
If you add or remove dependencies in the future, you can run the "npm install" command again to update the installed packages. If you install a new package using the "npm install <package_name>" command, it will be added to the "dependencies" section of the "package.json" file, and you can then run "npm install" to install it.
